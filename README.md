# Linked List LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various Linked List problems from LeetCode. The solutions are implemented in Java and cover a wide range of linked list-related problems, including sorting, merging, reversing, detecting cycles, and more.

## 📌 Topics Covered
- **Basic Operations**: Insertion, deletion, and traversal of linked lists.
- **Sorting & Merging**: Merge two sorted lists, merge nodes in between zeros, sort lists, etc.
- **Reversing & Rotation**: Reverse a linked list, reverse in K groups, rotate list, etc.
- **Cycle Detection**: Detect cycle in a linked list, find cycle start, etc.
- **Palindrome & Twin Sum**: Check if a linked list is a palindrome, find maximum twin sum, etc.
- **Partitioning & Splitting**: Partition a list, split a linked list into parts, etc.
- **Conversions**: Convert binary number in a linked list to integer, convert sorted list to BST, etc.
- **Other Challenges**: Find critical points, flatten binary tree to linked list, swap nodes, etc.
